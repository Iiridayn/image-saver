Basically a lightweight personal booru, with a strong emphasis on intelligent source detection and correlation.

Client (browser extension) - API Server (go) personal image bookmarker w/tags. Also should probably have a built in HTTP website server on the API server. Go chosen as 1) designed for writing servers, 2) cross platform (esp windows), and 3) reasonably small binary distribution size. The same thing runs on the user's desktop as on beefy remote backup and aggregation/search/sharing servers.

Can backup/retrieve db on remote server w/un/pw.

Might expand to include other media (ie, videos, music playlists by tag search, etc). Give me unlimited time. :P.

Side7 has categories, but also image classes - good selection. Ratings have reason tags, also neat.
